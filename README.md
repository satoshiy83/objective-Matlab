# objective-Matlab
This project provides fundamental objective classes for Matlab.

An objective class SYObject and its subclasses can contain data of some fundamental types (array, dictionary, and image for example) and provide methods to handle the data.
They are designed partially immetating Objective-C.
Subfolders contain short scripts and class files specific to some purposes, refered by SYObject family.

Other Matlab projects I created are using this framework.
